Module #1	Into to web development		est 20-30 min

1. define the title web developer

	*"Can anyone tell me what a web developer does?"

	*"A web developer is a programmer who specializes in,
	 or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications,
	 or distributed network applications that are run over HTTP from a web server to a web browser."
	- Wikipedia

	*"basicaly, we make everything on the internet"

	*recite favorite websites (facebook,google, etc.)

	*Big promise: "at the end of this class you will all be web developers.
			and today we're going to build the one thing that every
			web developer should have. You're very own website."
 
2.preview finished product (resume/protfolio)
	*pull up template site on browser
	
	*"The best part about this site is it can stay with you forever.Every time you master something new
	tell the world. Evertime you build something cool you can show the world. you can keep building on this
	site a little bit everyday until eventualy people will want you to build things for them. If you want this
	can be a career for you"

	*walk through the page sections and instruct the class to start thinking about what to fill in.
 
3.Hello world.
	*open a browser and text editor

	*have students type hello world and save as html file

	*drag and drop file for 'aha' moment

4.How the web works(how did the hello world trick work)

	*explain the difference between browser and server
		"The internet is just a big network of computers that talk to each other and share files.
			There are two types of computers on this network.They're called clients and servers.A server
			stores the files that make up a website.Like the file we just made to write hello world on the screen.
			A client is your computer.How do you view a website?You type it's name into browser! The browser uses that
			name to find a server then it asks the server for the files to build the website you asked for.The browser
			then reads the files like instuctions or blue prints and builds the website right before your eyes.
			Since our file was already on your computer all we had to do was give it to the browser.Them the browser
			read it and builds it and you have your first webpage!

	*quick description of the big three of front end development (html,css,javascript)
		#"Let's start with html. That's the type of file we just used to write hello world
			 This is the simplest programming language you can learn. basicaly it's a list
			of all the things you want in your website. paragraphs,links, pictures are all listed with html. "

		#"Next we have CSS. It makes things pretty,that's all it does.Your background color, font sizes, even 
			where everything is laid out on your page is controled by CSS"

		#"Javascript is where things get a little tricky.This is the language that does all the cool stuff.
			It can build anything from calculaters to video games.
			It's not hard to learn but it takes a little longer to explain
			than four hours.So today we're going to show you a little bit of a special type of javascript 
			called jQuery. We're going to use it to build something called an accordian on your site. "
